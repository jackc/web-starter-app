# Web Starter App

This is a starter web application. It is not a web framework. It is how I prefer to start web applications.

## Prerequisites

* [Go](https://go.dev/) - Backend programming language
* [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) - Version manager for build tools like NodeJS and Ruby
* [watchexec](https://watchexec.github.io/) - File system watcher used to trigger rebuilds
