# Server Programming Language

The candidate languages considered were Go and Ruby (with Rails).

While Ruby is a very pleasant language to work in much of the time, and Rails projects can be developed extremely rapidly, Ruby and Rails are extremely complicated and magical. I've been building production Rails applications from before Rails v1 to the present. But it is extremely magical, and when things aren't working, it can be unreasonably difficult to figure out why.

It takes longer to start a project in Go, but the code tends to be easy to quickly understand. With the proper libraries and an application starter kit, I think that it should be possible to approach the productivity Rails offers without also incurring the complexity costs.
